# Summary

CRISPR/Cas-based and related gene editing technologies have made it possible for many laboratories to perform genome editing with relative ease. These tools have helped to provide valuable information regarding genetic interactions and in the advancement of gene therapy in precision medicine.

This new suite of virtual and lab-based training courses offers participants the opportunity to delve deeper into the complexities of genetic engineering by providing a comprehensive overview of the theory and practical laboratory skills required for the genetic manipulation of mammalian cells for cellular modelling and screening. The courses will each be focused on a particular learning outcome: (1) Genome Informatics and Computational Design and Analysis (2) Cellular Generation and Modelling and (3) Pooled and Arrayed Genetic Screening. Each course will consist of interactive practicals, demonstrations, discussion sessions, and lectures by international experts.

# Target Audience

This course is targeted at postdoctoral scientists, advanced PhD students actively engaged in or soon to commence relevant research. It is also suitable for facility managers and principal investigators wishing to bring the latest genetic modification technologies into their facilities or groups.
